Backend build with rails-api, frontend with React.

Application has the following implemented features:

#### Customer Features
- [x] CF-1: Customers can sign up, using their email as username.
* After signing up, the user should receive a welcome email (does not need styling).
- [ ] CF-2: Customers can log in and out.
- [x] CF-3: Customers can view all products in a gridded view, no matter if theyâ€™re logged in or not.
- [x] CF-4: Each grid item displays the name of the product, the brand name, the model number and the price.
- See https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/ for an example of a gridded view (but without pictures).
- [ ] CF-5: Customers can click on a product to see details about it in a modal.
- [ ] CF-6: The modal has the same info as the grid view for each product, plus the provided description of the product.
- [ ] CF-7: Customers can add products to a cart.
- [ ] CF-8: "Add to cart" buttons should be on the modal for the product.
- [ ] CF-9: Customers can view their cart and the items inside.
- [ ] CF-10: Customers can delete an item from their cart.
- [ ] CF-11: Customers can buy all items on the cart.
* Use a "Buy" button on the cart page.
* Store this information on the database as an Order (products on the cart and customer).

#### Site Administrator Features
- [ ] SAF-1: Site administrators are able to login and out.
- [ ] SAF-2: There should be a default site administrator.
- [ ] SAF-3: Site administrators should be able to upload a JSON file with product descriptions.
* A JSON file with the products will be provided along this test. Please use this to create the products for the application.
- [ ] SAF-4: Site administrators can add products.
- [ ] DAF-5: Site administrators can list existing customers (customer users).

#### API User Features
- The site should provide a (possibly RESTful) API with the following features:
- [x] APIF-1: An endpoint to list all products.
- [x] APIF-2: An endpoint to list a product given it's ID.
- [x] APIF-3: An endpoint to create a product.
- [x] APIF-4: An endpoint to update the price of a product.
- [x] APIF-5: Querying the API should only be possible if an authentication token is provided as part of the request's header.
- [x] APIF-6: Appropriate success and error status codes and messages should be returned for each endpoint.
- [x] APIF-7: All api requests and responses should use JSON format.

#### Database Tasks
- [ ] DBT-1: Configure the Rails application to dump the database schema to an sql file.
- [ ] DBT-2: Create a database view to display the number of orders a customer has (customer email, number of orders placed).
